Introduction
============

If you don't know, then don't ask.  In order to run this script you need to install the json library. In your R editor, run the following command:  install.packages("rjson").   


Execution
=========

In order to execute the basic script from the command line, use: "RScript collectData.r 113", for example.

The script itself can be run in R also, but you have to define the argument for the market data and url manually.
